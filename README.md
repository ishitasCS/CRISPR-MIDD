# CRISPR-MIDD
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can identify and classify the type of off-target caused by CRISPR-CAS9

CRISPR/Cas9 is a groundbreaking gene editing technology that has shown immense promise across various fields such as medical, agricultural, and environmental. However, a critical limitation of the system lies in the potential for off-target effects. This occurs when the guide RNA unintentionally leads the Cas9 enzyme to cleave the wrong parts of the gene, creating what is known as off-target sites. Although numerous studies have been conducted to pinpoint potential off-target sites, the methodologies employed often fall short in accurately assessing the full scope of risks. Many of these studies merely rely on counting the number of mismatches within a single target sequence, providing a simplistic scoring system. However, these approaches overlook a crucial aspectâ€”the possibility of insertions and deletions in the off-target site. As a result, there is no existing approach that can effectively identify potential active off-target sites while simultaneously considering the occurrence of insertions, deletions, and mismatches at these sites.

In order to address this issue, a two part Convolution Neural Network named CRISPR-MIDD was developed in order to identify potential active off-target sites with good accuracy. In addition to detecting these sites, it also goes a step further by classifying them as either mismatches, insertions, or deletions. The CIRCLE-Seq dataset was used to train and test the model that classifies off target sites as either mismatch, insertion or deletion. Additional evaluation for the model was done using the GUIDE-Seq dataset. The model for classifying target sequences as active off-target or not underwent training, validation, and testing using the CRISPOR dataset. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, such as Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Network, were used to identify the optimal performer for distinguishing off-target gene sequences. The Convolutional Neural Network emerged as the most accurate and efficient algorithm, demonstrating superior accuracy and processing speed.
